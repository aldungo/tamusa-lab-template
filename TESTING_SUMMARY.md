## Testing Workflow

### **For Instructors:**

1. **Pre-Assignment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Verify testing environment
   ./run_all_tests.sh
   ```

2. **During Assignment Period**
   ```bash
   # Quick individual student check
   ./run_lab1_tests.sh
   ```

3. **Batch Grading**
   ```bash
   # Process multiple student submissions
   for dir in student_submissions/*/; do
       cd "$dir"
       ../../run_all_tests.sh > results.txt
       cd ../..
   done
   ```

### **For Students (Self-Testing):**

1. **After Completing InClass1**
   ```bash
   javac InClass1_FirstName_LastName.java
   java InClass1_FirstName_LastName
   ```

2. **After Completing Lab1**
   ```bash
   javac Lab1_FirstName_LastName.java
   java Lab1_FirstName_LastName
   ```

3. **Before Submission**
   ```bash
   # Verify both programs work
   ./run_all_tests.sh
   ```
