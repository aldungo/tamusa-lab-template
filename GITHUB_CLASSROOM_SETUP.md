## Best Practices for Lab 1

### For Instructors
- **Clear Communication**: Provide detailed instructions about GitHub account setup
- **Early Testing**: Have students test their environment before the assignment deadline
- **Office Hours**: Schedule extra help sessions for students new to programming
- **Sample Demonstrations**: Show the complete workflow during class
- **Flexible Deadlines**: Consider extended deadlines for environment setup issues

### For Students
- **Start Early**: Begin the assignment well before the deadline
- **Read Thoroughly**: Complete the entire README.md before starting to code
- **Test Frequently**: Compile and run your program after each step
- **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to seek help during class or office hours
- **Save Often**: Regularly save and commit your work to prevent data loss

## Assessment Guidelines

### Grading Criteria
- **Technical Implementation** (70%): Correct syntax, compilation, execution
- **Content Quality** (20%): Meaningful personal statements, appropriate variable names
- **Process Compliance** (10%): Proper file naming, submission format, following instructions

### Common Feedback Areas

This Lab 1 template provides a foundation for students to learn programming fundamentals while getting comfortable with the development tools they'll use throughout the course.

### Step 1: Create Assignment Repository Template

1. **Upload all files** to your template repository:
   ```
   InClass3.java (student starter code)
   InClass3Test.java
   run_tests.sh
   .github/classroom/autograding.json
   .github/workflows/classroom.yml
   README.md
   TESTING_GUIDE.md

3. **Calculate surface area** using 6 * Math.pow(side, 2)
4. **Display results** with proper formatting
5. **Handle all data types** (integers, decimals, zero values)

### Expected Output Format
```
Please enter the length of the side of the cube: [user input]
The volume of the cube is [calculated volume]
The surface area of the cube is [calculated surface area]
```

### Testing Locally
Students can test their code locally using:
```bash
# Compile and run program
javac InClass3.java
java InClass3

# Run comprehensive test suite
./run_tests.sh
```
